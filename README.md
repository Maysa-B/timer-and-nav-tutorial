## Timer and Nav Tutorial

This timer project was developed by me using React, React Hoots, and Tailwind CSS. The main purpose was to create an animation that opens a menu with Tailwind, so I would be able to produce an [article](https://dev.to/maysab/how-to-create-an-animation-to-open-a-menu-with-tailwind-in-5-steps-1llj) about it.
